A Brief Description of the MAV Output Files
As you can see, this folder contains a series of photos with structural columns and labeled damage. 
These photos are the outputs from the scans conducted by the MAV, and the damage identified by the pretrained model.
The photos contain exactly the following: 
- The scanned structural column in the lab (with damage)
- The area of damage highlighted and covered in white
- The labels identifying the damage (as done by the pretrained model)
