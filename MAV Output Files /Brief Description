A Quick Description of the MAV Output Files

These photos, as you will can see, are actual results outputted by our MAV using the pre-trained model described in the README. 
These scanned columns all contain structural damage - spalling and rebar have been highlighted in particular. 
The type of damage has been identified by the pretrained model, boxed, and labeled in yellow.
